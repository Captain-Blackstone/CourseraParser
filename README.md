A couple of notes.

- The parser should be available here: http://coursera-parser.online, but if it's not, please, check this IP: 34.125.41.15. If it does not work either, check the index.html. The server might be down for some reasons.
- You may notice the problems with encoding in some of the course descriptions. I spent some time trying to figure out the right encoding - Coursera itself swears it's utf-8, but it doesn't seem that way. So, sorry for this inconvenience.
- The website might take some time to load because of the table size. Wait for the buttons to appear)
